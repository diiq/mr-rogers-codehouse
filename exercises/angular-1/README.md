Learning Goals for Today:
what is
  - mvc (model, view, controller) - Learn more about the controller
  - module - a way of grouping a bunch of stuff together.
  - component - Stuff that is all angular related component on the screen that has a significant amount of functionality within it. Example, Amazon has about a dozen components on any given page
  - angular

  make a component that has three input boxes
  first name
  last name
  fav food group

  component also has button
  prints to the screen "hello [first name + last name]. I also like [fav food group]."


Why use angular - keeps the model and the visible page in sync
