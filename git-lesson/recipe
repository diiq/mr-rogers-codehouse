1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
3/4 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
Preheat to 375 degrees F. 
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. 
Melt butter. Cool slightly. 
Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla until smooth.
Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. 
Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients; do not over mix. 
Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.
Roll heaping tablespoons of the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. 
Bake until golden 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies.
