Need:
1) item component
2) add item component
3) component that adds everything together
  - ng-repeat to iterate all the items that are added

Sam would like a second page on our app


** will probably have a item service doc, but will not need models file

component - functionality and appearance in a box on a page

mvc -

model - how we represent the word (in a to-do list, it's the array of list items)
view - what it looks like (in angular, it's written in html)
controller - how the model changes when the user interacts

what is
  - mvc (model, view, controller) - Learn more about the controller
  - module - a way of grouping a bunch of stuff together.
  - controller - Stuff that is all angular related component on the screen that has
    a significant amount of functionality within it. Example, Amazon has about a dozen
    components on any given page

ng-app - connects module (module name) to the main html of your app
ng-model - is for all input elements
ng-repeat - used to display all items in an array on the page
  <div ng-repeat =" foop in $ctrl.foops">Hi</div> -- for each foop in foops say hi.
dependency injection - a way of saying 'hey i need these services' and angular providing them to you
  - its how you get the services you need
service - allows you to share info across the app, connect functions across components

For Saturday's assessment - practice writing components and services
