// Angular is a javascript library, like jquery! But it's not a miscellaneous
// collection of functions; it's a 'framework' -- all the pieces work together.

// In order for our code to join in on the fun, we have to package it up for
// angular to find it. We do that using a module.

/// Making a module:
angular.module("toDoList", []);

// REFERRING to a module:
angular.module("toDoList");
