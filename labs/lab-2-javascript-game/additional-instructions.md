# Additional Instructions for Lab 2

I'd like you to combine parts 1 and 2 of the lab PDF; rather than writing a big loopy version *first*, I'd like you to write a version made from many smaller functions.

I'd also like you to *use your judgement* about how to break the game into functions, and what to call those functions. If you feel the instructions have made good choices, feel free to follow them, but _think critically_ about it!

Part 1 and 2 are due first. Parts 3 and 4 will be separate assignments.
