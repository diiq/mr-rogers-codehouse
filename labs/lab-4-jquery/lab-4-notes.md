What do I need to include:

Representation of the room:
  visual of tables - number of tables? = 9
  number for each table - 1-9

Tables:
  color rep for available - light for available
    - color/highlight should appear when user's cursor is over an available table.
    - cursor form changes to something indicating it's clickable while over an available table
  color rep for unavailable - dark for unavailable

Form:
  Pulls number from table that's clicked on (only available tables)
  Input 1 - Name of person reserving the table
  Input 2 - Phone number of person making reservation
  Input 3 - Number of people reservation is for
  Button - Save changes (hide form)
    - updates color of that table to reserved color if form is saved
    - state of table cannot be changed once it is reserved
  Provide option (reaction) if user wants to click out of form (guest decides not to reserve table)
